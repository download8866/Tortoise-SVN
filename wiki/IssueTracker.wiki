Chances are good that if you're on this page, you've come either to complain about TortoiseSVN, or you've come to check on a previous complaint about TortoiseSVN. Hey, we understand that. And for what it's worth, TortoiseSVN is the amazing software that it is largely because of the constructive criticism we've received about it over the years. Having said that, we strongly  recommend that if you've not done so already, you read the [http://tortoisesvn.net/report_a_bug Report a bug] page. Not only will you learn how to increase the quality of your own complaints and requests, but in doing so, you'll increase the likelihood that we'll recognize them as constructive.

You can find our issue tracker [http://code.google.com/p/tortoisesvn/issues/list here], but remember, issues which have not been discussed on the mailing list *will* be discarded.
